## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select files in the Ansible folder may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting access to the network.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the logs and system statistics.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function   | IP Address | OS    |
|----------|------------|------------|-------|
| Jump Box | Gateway    | 10.0.0.4   | Linux |
| Web-1    | DVWA Host  | 10.0.0.5   | Linux |
| Web-2    | DVWA Host  | 10.0.0.6   | Linux |
| ELK-VM   | ELK Host   | 10.1.0.4   | Linux |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet.

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- 45.29.51.35

Machines within the network can only be accessed by 10.0.0.4.

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box |         Yes         | 45.29.51.35          |
| Web-1    |          No         | 10.0.0.4             |
| Web-2    |          No         | 10.0.0.4             |
| Elk-VM   |          No         | 10.0.0.4             |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because it reduces human error and allows multiple identical machines to be configured quickly.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Downloads and installs docker and python3-pip.
- Configures the ELK machine to use more virtual memory.
- Downloads and launches a elk container.
- Enables docker to start on boot.

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- 10.0.0.5
- 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeats
- Metricbeats

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat records instances of sudo commands, ssh logins, and creation of new users and groups for each machine.
- Metricbeat gauges CPU, Memory, and Disk usage for each machine. It also measures the levels of inbound and outbound traffic.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned:

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the install-elk.yml file to /etc/ansible.
- Update the hosts file to include 10.1.0.4 in a group named [elk].
- Run the playbook, and navigate to http://(elk_server_IP):5601/app/kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.
